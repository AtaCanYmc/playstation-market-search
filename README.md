## Introduction
In today's digital age, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play a crucial role in connecting various systems and services, enabling seamless communication and data exchange. The PlayStation Market Search API is built using Express.js, a popular framework for building web applications in Node.js, and incorporates web scraping techniques to fetch data from the PlayStation Store website.

## Features
- Search for games on the PlayStation Store.
- Retrieve game information such as names, prices, and URLs.
- Simple and lightweight API.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript.
- Familiarity with Express.js and web scraping concepts.

## Installation
To install the dependencies, clone the repository and run npm install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/playstation-market-api.git
cd playstation-market-api
npm install
```

## Usage
To start the server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server will run on port 3000. You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

## Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoint:

- `/search?query=searchTerm`: Search for games on the PlayStation Store based on the provided search term.

Example usage:

```
